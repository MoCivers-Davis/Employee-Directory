# Employee-Directory-App

## Overview

For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. This assignment required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Technology
* This app used React.js, JSON, GitHub Pages, GitHub, and CSS
* As a developer I had the opportunity to use React components, props, and states to pass information and to set values

## Deployment 
* https://github.com/MoCivers-Davis/Employee-Directory - GitHub Repo
* https://mocivers-davis.github.io/Employee-Directory/- UI Deployed
